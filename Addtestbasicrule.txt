<HARD RULE>
Rule1,no user input needed to continue the test.(EG,no thread blocking code)
Rule2,No over-reach,but allow less-reach.Simple reason.
less reach=not documented,not tested,not verified,just continue daily life.
Over reach=wrong document,wrong test,false alarm,then question life choice.
(Just simply,give the last KNOWN version that passes,no need guess about past behaviour.)
Rule3,Even fails,obey rule one do not freeze for user interaction.Only allows creations of logs in any form.(Console,write text file,etc.)

<Soft rule>
Rule1,minimal reproducible.It is good to test all behaviour.But a thousand line code for a small test is quite questionable.
Rule2,Max one file per behaviour test.Unless it is a file dependent test please,please make sure it is Tested within a file.

License,
Apache License ver 2,
no need to keep fighting over license.Friendly Company can take whatever and use and contribute near to hassle free.
Some code that are contributed may not have the extra bloated license notice.
But do note that a simple comment such as "Lua_RI_testsuite" is enough to state that is is using this repo wide license.
Of course,one could add their own license notice,Which OVERWRITES the repo wide default license.
However,the target overwrite license must be less restrictive in distribution than Apache v2.<BSD,MIT,etc...>

EG case for reference,
SUCCESS CASE.
